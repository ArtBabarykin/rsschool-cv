## About

I am passionate about web development and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences. I build websites and web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(ES6/ES7).

I've been studying tech on my own for quite a while. Now I want to put all my knowledge into a system and pick up some new skills and best practices.

I look forward to sharpen my JavaScript and build up expertise in algorithms. Ideally I want to learn how to think like a programmer.
