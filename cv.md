## About

I am passionate about web development and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences. I build websites and web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(ES6/ES7).

I've been studying tech on my own for quite a while. Now I want to put all my knowledge into a system and pick up some new skills and best practices.

I look forward to sharpen my JavaScript and build up expertise in algorithms. Ideally I want to learn how to think like a programmer.

## Skills

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

## Code Snippet

```
const pow = (x,n) => {
    return n === 0 ? 1 : x * pow(x, n - 1);
}
```

## Experience

I have a few website-clones built by tutorials and multiple mini-projects demonstrating my expertise in related web technologies.

## Education

Bachelor of Arts, Oginsky Music College, Maladzechna, Belarus, 2010

## English

I can read, write and communicate.
